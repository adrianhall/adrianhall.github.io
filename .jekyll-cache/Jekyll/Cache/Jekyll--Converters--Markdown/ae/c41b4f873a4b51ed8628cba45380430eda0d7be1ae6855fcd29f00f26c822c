I"¢<p>Recently, I‚Äôve given myself the task of learning the ‚Äúnative‚Äù mobile development platforms.  That means Java or Kotlin for Android and Swift or Objective-C for iOS development.  Kotlin is a ways behind Java for Android development and I already knew (somewhat) the Java language, so that one was relatively easy.  Swift is the new kid on the block, but it‚Äôs obviously the way to go for iOS Development.</p>
