I"J<p>In my last article, I psted about <a href="/react%20native/2017/08/09/debugging-react-native-with-typescript-and-vscode/">getting TypeScript working with React Native</a>. I’m building a flexible, best-practices, Notes App in React Native. This means I need a backing store, and it has to be local for offline capabilities. React has a definite way of building data into the UI and the manipulation of that data is an architecture known as <a href="http://facebook.github.io/flux/">Flux</a>. Flux isn’t a concrete implementation, however. Normally, I would use <a href="http://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> as the concrete implementation. However, I have recently started working with <a href="https://mobx.js.org/">MobX</a> and I prefer it. This article is about integrating MobX into my application for the storage of the Notes data.</p>
