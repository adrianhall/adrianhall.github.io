I"Ì<p>Iâ€™m in the middle of building a GraphQL API for a restaurant review app that Iâ€™m building. Thus far, Iâ€™ve produced the schema and built the backend. However, the two donâ€™t know how to talk to one another. Specifically, how does the GraphQL insert a new location into DynamoDB, or do a geospatial search across ElasticSearch? This is the job of the resolversâ€Š-â€Šturn a GraphQL query into something that the back end data plane can understand.</p>
