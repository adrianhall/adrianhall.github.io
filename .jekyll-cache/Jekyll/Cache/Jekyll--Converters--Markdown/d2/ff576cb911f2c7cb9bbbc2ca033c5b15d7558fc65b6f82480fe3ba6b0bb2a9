I",<p>I’m building a demo Android app that is sort of like Instagram, but with some new cloud features (which I will mention as I go along) and a different design to make it different.  I plan to build this with the latest architecture for Android, in Kotlin, and learning a bunch of Android dev tricks along the way.  As with everything, there is a start, and this is that post.  I’m not going to tell you how to build your first Android app - there are plenty of tutorials on that.  I’m just going to cover some of the things that I found useful.</p>
