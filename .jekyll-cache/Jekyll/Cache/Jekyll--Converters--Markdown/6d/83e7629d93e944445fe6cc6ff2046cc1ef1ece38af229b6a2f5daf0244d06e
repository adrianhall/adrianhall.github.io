I"°<p>I love GraphQL even for the small apps. Generating a simple API allows me to change out back end details without re-compiling my front end. It also allows me to rotate API keys easily, handle authentication, and get in depth monitoring of the individual fields being used. So, naturally, when I am building a new weather app (donâ€™t judgeâ€Šâ€”â€Ševeryone makes one), I naturally want to use a weather API based on GraphQL.</p>
