I"á<p>Thus far in this series, Iâ€™ve <a href="/android/tailwind%20photos/2019/08/15/tailwind-photos-1/">established a decent splash screen and auth trigger page</a>, and <a href="/android/tailwind%20photos/2019/08/17/tailwind-photos-2/">integrated Facebook authentication</a> into my app.  The next authentication technique is <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating">Google Auth</a>.  If you followed along with the Facebook auth integration, you will know that I separated the actual Facebook part of it into a separate class, allowing me to clean up the code in the actual activity.  I also established provider-agnostic models for the authenticated user, which I will re-use in this post.</p>
