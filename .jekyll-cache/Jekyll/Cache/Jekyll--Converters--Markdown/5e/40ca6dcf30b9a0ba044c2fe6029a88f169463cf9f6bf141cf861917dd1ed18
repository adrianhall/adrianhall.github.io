I"_<p>Thus far in our story, we’ve covered <a href="/android/tailwind%20photos/2019/08/17/tailwind-photos-2/">Facebook</a>, <a href="/android/tailwind%20photos/2019/08/19/tailwinds-photos-3/">Google</a>, and <a href="/android/tailwind%20photos/2019/08/21/tailwind-photos-4/">Microsoft</a> authentication.  There is one more to do - Twitter.  Unfortunately, Twitter doesn’t have a nice vendor-provided SDK to do the work.  In fact, Twitter is fairly hostile to app developers, so I decided to forego the Twitter login (sorry!).  Instead, I’m going to cover the changes I made to support silent login.</p>
