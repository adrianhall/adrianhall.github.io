I"<p>One of the things I really miss from <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> was the support for <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>. TypeScript helps me immensely, but it really comes into its own with React programming as the PropTypes are specified for you (no more propTypes static). Iâ€™m also getting into <a href="https://mobx.js.org/">MobX</a> as a flux implementation and that uses decorators, which is native in TypeScript. There is lots to love in TypeScript.</p>
