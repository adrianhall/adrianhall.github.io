I"~<p>I’m loving <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> for my apps. It removes the ever shifting requirements that I implemented when I was doing “REST-like” backends and removes the complexity of having to do BFF (<a href="https://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/">Backend for your Frontend</a>) and the maintenance headaches that come with such architectures.</p>
