I"®<p>Iâ€™ve been working on a personal project, trying to get to grips with the various <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/">Android Architecture Components</a> and Kotlin. One of the things I came up with was the requirement to deal with type conversion when using a SQLite database and the <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/">Room persistence library</a>. Room is a nice abstraction to the internal SQLite database that converts models to tables within SQLite. Itâ€™s nice because it works alongside LiveData and RxJava to provide observable objectsâ€Šâ€”â€Šwhen the database changes, the observable changes as well.</p>
