I"<p>I’m progressing on my “master-detail” pattern for a react-native app. The actual implementation of master-detail is shockingly simple (more on that later). However, I bumped into some specific issues when I was implementing it. The first of these was covered last time – <a href="/react%20native/2017/07/26/handling-orientation-changes-in-react-native/">how to detect orientation changes in React Native</a>. The next is this. How do I implement swipe-right so that I can add a swipe-to-delete function to a FlatList.</p>
