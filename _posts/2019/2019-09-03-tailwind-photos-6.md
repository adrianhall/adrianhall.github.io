Over the last five blog posts, I've incorporated various social media authentication mechanisms and worked on silent authentication so that the user only ever has to log in once; if the user is logged in, they won't ever see a sign in prompt.  However, dealing with three distinct authentication mechanisms is not ideal.  What happens when I add a fourth authentication type, or decide to do something custom like a username and password?  Every time I use a new authentication scheme, my backend needs to understand this new scheme and deal with the authorization of the app to the backend.

In addition, I likely need to store my own profile information.  One of the capabilities I want, for example, is the ability to follow a user.  In this case, I'll need to store additional information that isn't available from the social media provider that is providing the basic information.

In short, I need a service in the cloud to store this sort of information.

Here is how it will work:

1. The user will authenticate with their social media provider of choice.
2. The app will send a request to `/api/token` to get a new JWT for my backend, using the authentication token from the social media provider.
3. The backend will validate the authentication token.  If it is valid, it will look the user up in a database of some sort.
  * If the user does not exist, then a `404 Not Found` response will be returned.
  * If the user exists and `state=REGISTERED`, then return a `200 Success` with a new JWT and the profile information.
  * If the user exists and `state=PENDING`, then return a `200 Success` without a JWT, but the existing profile information.
4. The app responds to the response.  If a JWT is received, move to the main app.  If not, go through registration.

Registration is done in two steps.  First, the app displays a page asking for name and email address.  This is submitted with the social media token to `/api/register`.  The backend will store the data with a `state=PENDING`, then send the user (via email) a code.  Finally, a response (`200 Success`) is returned with the data.  When the user gets the code, they put it into the app, which sends it to `/api/register?code=XXXXXX`.  This is validated, and then a `200 Success` with a JWT is returned.  The app can then move to the main app.

There are various error conditions to be programmed as well:

* When the registration email already exists, a `409 Conflict` will be returned.
* When the back end cannot validate the social media token, a  `401 Unauthorized` will be returned.
* When the code is wrong from `/api/register`, a `401 Unauthorized` will be returned.

## Backend Architecture

So far, so good.  What about the architecture of the backend?  There are several ways to implement the backend API within Azure. You need to decide on language, framework, and technologies.  There are a lot of decisions that are made during this process that are based on:

* Cost of running the backend (and expected revenue)
* Expected load on the backend
* Capabilities of the development team

Sometimes, it's better to use a serverless technology (for example, when you have a low volume site and can withstand a cold start occasionally because of app architecture).  Sometimes, it's better to use a container technology like Docker and Kubernetes (for example, when you have a higher volume site where the cost of the API calls exceeds the cost of the equivalent containers running all the time).  In short, these decisions come down to individual requirements.  Here are my decisions:

* I'm going to write the backend using Node/JavaScript.
* The database will be Azure CosmosDB.
* The APIs will be implemented using Azure Functions.
* Emails will be sent using SendGrid.

The architecture looks like the following:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2019/2019-09-03-image1.png)

Of course, I want repeatable deployments, so everything is going to be deployed via Azure Resource Manager (or **ARM**).  This involves writing an ARM template (which I pretty much always write based on a template, but I'll go through the basics here), and then running a deployment script using the Azure CLI.

Let's say I have a prefix called `twprod`.  I'd want the following resources:

* Azure App Insights: `twprodinsights`
* Azure CosmosDB: `twproddb`
* Azure Storage: `twprodstorage`
* SendGrid: `twprodsendgrid` 
* Azure Function App: `twprodfunctions`
* Azure App Service Plan: `twprodfnappsvcplan`

## Build an ARM Template

An ARM template is a JSON formatted file called `azuredeploy.json`.  I'm going to put it in [its own repository](https://github.com/adrianhall/tailwind-photos-backend/tree/blog-6), but you can combine this stuff in the repository for the app if you like.  Since I want to also do an iOS version of the app, I think separating it is a good idea.

An ARM template has four sections:

* `parameters` defines the things that you pass in from the Azure CLI during the deployment.
* `variables` defines the things you use during resource deployment for variable configuration.
* `resources` define the resources that will be deployed. 
* `outputs` define what you need to know after the deployment to properly integrate your backend into your app.

Your basic ARM template looks like this:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {

  },
  "variables": {

  },
  "resources": [
    
  ],
  "outputs": {

  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

After that, it's a fill-in-the-blanks process.  

## Parameters

I don't like to use too many parameters.  These are passed in from outside, so they need to be specified exactly the same each time.  It's better to adjust the template since then you have it under source control rather than relying on the whim of the person deploying the template.  Here are mine:

{% highlight json %}
  "parameters": {
    "prefix": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "twprod",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "The prefix for all the resources"
      }
    },
    "location": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "[resourceGroup().location]",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "The location for all resources"
      }
    },
    "sendgridPassword": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "enter-a-password-here",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "The password for the Sendgrid service"
      }
    }
  },
{% endhighlight %}

I have three parameters that I can pass in.  The prefix allows me to specify an dev environment, as an example.  The location allows me to specify an alternate region.  Finally, Sendgrid needs a password.  In all cases, I've specified a default value.  If the user deploying the script doesn't specify any parameters, it doesn't matter since the right thing will happen naturally.

## Variables

Let's move on to variables.  This is where you can construct the names of all the resources based on a prefix.  I also like to put the options that are available to the resources here.

{% highlight json %}
    "variables": {
        "appInsightsName": "[concat(parameters('prefix'), 'insights')]",
        "cosmosDbName": "[concat(parameters('prefix'), 'db')]",
        "cosmosDbTier": "Standard",
        "sendgridAccountName": "[concat(parameters('prefix'), 'sendgrid')]",
        "storageAccountName": "[concat(parameters('prefix'), 'storage')]",
        "storageAccountId": "[concat(resourceGroup().id,'/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/',variables('storageAccountName'))]",
        "storageAccountType": "Standard_LRS",
        "functionAppName": "[concat(parameters('prefix'), 'functions')]",
        "functionAppRuntime": "node",
        "appHostingPlanName": "[concat(parameters('prefix'), 'appsvcplan')]"
    },
{% endhighlight %}

Variables are computed, which means there are operators (called functions) - like concatenation (which is the one I use most often).  For a list of operators, see [the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-functions).

## Resources

The next step is to add the resources to the template.  You can search the [ARM quickstart repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates) for templates for individual resources.  However, putting them together is your job.  Let's go through each one in turn:

**Storage**

Storage is the easiest to do since it's pretty much at the bottom of the heap for the architecture.  It has no dependencies.

{% highlight json %}
  {
      "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
      "name": "[variables('storageAccountName')]",
      "apiVersion": "2019-04-01",
      "location": "[parameters('location')]",
      "kind": "Storage",
      "sku": {
          "name": "[variables('storageAccountType')]"
      }
  },
{% endhighlight %}

You are probably wondering how on earth you would figure this out without examples.  I did too.  First of all, there is a [reference for ARM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/).  This also has references for each resource.  You can take a look at the [Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.storage/2019-04-01/storageaccounts) resource as an example.  This gives you, among other things, an example template, a list of property values and what the properties mean.  You should bookmark the reference if you are doing ARM development.

**CosmosDB**

Cosmos is a complex NoSQL database that has multiple facets.  Each facet corresponds to a method for accessing the data.  You can choose from MongoDB, SQL, Cassandra, and so on.  You have to decide on the facet during deployment.  It can't be changed later.  To deploy a CosmosDB, you need to create a database account:

{% highlight json %}
  {
      "type": "Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts",
      "name": "[variables('cosmosDbName')]",
      "apiVersion": "2015-04-08",
      "location": "[parameters('location')]",
      "properties": {
          "locations": [
              {
                  "locationName": "[parameters('location')]"
              }
          ],
          "databaseAccountOfferType": "[variables('cosmosDbTier')]"
      }
  },
{% endhighlight %}

This one has some required properties, so consult the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.documentdb/2015-04-08/databaseaccounts) to see the available properties.  The most notable one you may want to tweak is the default consistency level.

**App Insights**

App Insights is called "insights" when looking for the resource definition:

{% highlight json %}
  {
      "type": "Microsoft.Insights/components",
      "name": "[variables('appInsightsName')]",
      "apiVersion": "2018-05-01-preview",
      "location": "[parameters('location')]",
      "kind": "web",
      "tags": {
          "[concat('hidden-link:', resourceGroup().id, '/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/', variables('functionAppName'))]": "Resource"
      },
      "properties": {
          "Application_Type": "web",
          "ApplicationId": "[variables('functionAppName')]"
      }
  },
{% endhighlight %}

Azure Functions requires a special linkage, so make sure you use this recipe whenever you are using a function app.

> **Be careful of region availability**
> Sometimes, the service will not be available in all regions.  Currently, Azure Monitor is not available in all regions.  If you wanted to run your service in (for example) Canada East, you would have to hard code the region for App Insights since [it isn't available in that region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=monitor).

**SendGrid**

SendGrid is one of those useful resources that I turn to time and again for sending out emails:

{% highlight json %}
  {
      "type": "Sendgrid.Email/accounts",
      "name": "[variables('sendgridAccountName')]",
      "apiVersion": "2015-01-01",
      "location": "[parameters('location')]",
      "plan": {
          "name": "free",
          "publisher": "Sendgrid",
          "product": "sendgrid_azure"
      },
      "properties": {
          "password": "[parameters('sendgridPassword')]",
          "acceptMarketingEmails": "0",
          "email": ""
      }
  },
{% endhighlight %}

Note that all the services defined thus far don't have dependencies.  The Azure Resource Manager can create these in parallel.

**Azure Functions**

Azure Functions, by contrast, depends on just about everything else.  There are two parts to the Azure Function - the hosting plan (which we are setting to be dynamic) and the actual function app.  Here is the hosting plan:

{% highlight json %}
  {
      "type": "Microsoft.Web/serverfarms",
      "name": "[variables('appHostingPlanName')]",
      "apiVersion": "2018-02-01",
      "location": "[parameters('location')]",
      "sku": {
          "name": "Y1",
          "tier": "Dynamic"
      },
      "properties": {
          "name": "[variables('appHostingPlanName')]",
          "computeMode": "Dynamic"
      }
  },
{% endhighlight %}

There are different hosting plans available - one for App Service Environments, one for a non-dynamic hosting plan and one for dynamic hosting (which can only be used with function apps).  If you are running a web service as well, then you can combine the app service plan for that with the function app one.

Talking of which, here is the function app:

{% highlight json %}
  {
      "type": "Microsoft.Web/sites",
      "name": "[variables('functionAppName')]",
      "apiVersion": "2018-11-01",
      "location": "[parameters('location')]",
      "kind": "functionapp",
      "dependsOn": [
          "[resourceId('Microsoft.Web/serverfarms', variables('appHostingPlanName'))]",
          "[resourceId('Microsoft.Web/serverfarms', variables('appHostingPlanName'))]",
          "[resourceId('Sendgrid.Email/accounts', variables('sendgridAccountName'))]",
          "[resourceId('Microsoft.Insights/components', variables('appInsightsName'))]",
          "[resourceId('Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts', variables('cosmosDbName'))]"
      ],
      "properties": {
          "serverFarmId": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Web/serverfarms', variables('appHostingPlanName'))]",
          "siteConfig": {
              "appSettings": [
                  {
                      "name": "AzureWebJobsDashboard",
                      "value": "[concat('DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=', variables('storageAccountName'), ';AccountKey=', listKeys(variables('storageAccountId'),'2019-04-01').keys[0].value)]"
                  },
                  {
                      "name": "AzureWebJobsStorage",
                      "value": "[concat('DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=', variables('storageAccountName'), ';AccountKey=', listKeys(variables('storageAccountId'),'2019-04-01').keys[0].value)]"
                  },
                  {
                      "name": "WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING",
                      "value": "[concat('DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=', variables('storageAccountName'), ';AccountKey=', listKeys(variables('storageAccountId'),'2019-04-01').keys[0].value)]"
                  },
                  {
                      "name": "WEBSITE_CONTENTSHARE",
                      "value": "[toLower(variables('functionAppName'))]"
                  },
                  {
                      "name": "FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION",
                      "value": "~2"
                  },
                  {
                      "name": "WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION",
                      "value": "10.14.1"
                  },
                  {
                      "name": "APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY",
                      "value": "[reference(resourceId('Microsoft.Insights/components/', variables('appInsightsName')), '2018-05-01-preview').InstrumentationKey]"
                  },
                  {
                      "name": "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME",
                      "value": "[variables('functionAppRuntime')]"
                  },
                  {
                      "name": "SENDGRID_CONNECTIONSTRING",
                      "value": "[concat('Server=',reference(resourceId('Sendgrid.Email/accounts',variables('sendgridAccountName'))).smtpServer,';User=',reference(resourceId('Sendgrid.Email/accounts', variables('sendgridAccountName'))).username,';Password=',parameters('sendgridPassword'))]"
                  },
                  {
                      "name": "COSMOSDB_CONNECTIONSTRING",
                      "value": "[concat('Endpoint=https://',variables('cosmosDbName'),'.documents.azure.com;Key=',listKeys(resourceId('Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts', variables('cosmosDbName')), '2015-04-08').primaryMasterKey)]"
                  }
              ]
          }
      }
  }
{% endhighlight %}

All the app settings become environment variables for your code to read, so you really want them to be easily understood.  This is an opportunity for you to inform your function app (a collection of functions) where your other resources are located. A lot of these app settings are constructed at this time so that the function can easily digest the contents.

## Outputs

Finally, let's take a look at the outputs.  We only need one output - the base URI of the function app.  This is because everything else is relative to that URI.  The base URI of the function app is what we (eventually) inject into our Android or iOS app to ensure that the app can talk to the backend.

{% highlight json %}
    "outputs": {
        "baseUri": {
            "value": "[concat('https://',variables('functionAppName'),'.azurewebsites.net')]",
            "type": "string"
        }
    }
{% endhighlight %}

## Deploying your resources

Now that we've got a completed deployment script, we can deploy it to a new resource group.  I'm using the Azure CLI for this.  First, login:

{% highlight bash %}
az login
{% endhighlight %}

Then create a resource group:

{% highlight bash %}
az group create --name twprod --location "West US"
{% endhighlight %}

Remember that all the resources are going to be located in the same region unless you specify otherwise.  The default region is the location of the resource group.  Let's kick off a deployment:

{% highlight bash %}
az group deployment create -g twprod --template-file .\azuredeploy.json --debug
{% endhighlight %}

I'm putting maximum logging here as it's helpful to identify issues with your template that prevent it from even being submitted.  You'll get an error message showing the offending code.  At that point, it's best to review the code and compare to the documentation.

Once the deployment is running, you can review the deployment in progress:

* Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
* Select **Resource Groups** and then the resource group you are deploying.
* Under **Deployments**, you will see `1 deploying`.  Click on that link.
* Click the deployment.

You will see the resources as they are created.  If any resource fails, look at the **Operation details** to see what is wrong.  For instance, here was my first run of the deployment:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2019/2019-09-03-image2.png)

Let's take a look at the errors.  First, the one for Sendgrid:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "error": {
    "code": "InvalidTemplate",
    "message": "Unable to process template language expressions for resource '/subscriptions/76b3a38a-6e13-467e-89f5-14e427f2fda8/resourceGroups/twprod/providers/Sendgrid.Email/accounts/twprodsendgrid' at line '1' and column '2069'. 'The template variable 'sendgridPassword' is not found. Please see https://aka.ms/arm-template/#variables for usage details.'",
    "additionalInfo": [
      {
        "type": "TemplateViolation",
        "info": {
          "lineNumber": 1,
          "positionNumber": 2069,
          "snippet": ""
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is fairly obvious.  I didn't specify the `sendgridPassword` variable.  This was an error in the template because the `sendgridPassword` is actually a parameter, so that was an easy fix.  The second one is for App Insights:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "error": {
    "code": "NoRegisteredProviderFound",
    "message": "No registered resource provider found for location 'westus' and API version '2018-05-01' for type 'components'. The supported api-versions are '2014-04-01, 2014-08-01, 2014-12-01-preview, 2015-05-01, 2018-05-01-preview'. The supported locations are ', eastus, southcentralus, northeurope, westeurope, southeastasia, westus2, uksouth, canadacentral, centralindia, japaneast, australiaeast, koreacentral, francecentral, centralus, eastus2, eastasia, westus, southafricanorth'."
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Again, this was an error in the template.  I was using the wrong API version.  I needed to use API version `2018-05-01-preview`.  Once I had corrected those two issues, I can run the same deployment script again.  The Azure Resource Manager will figure out what needs to be changed and only deploy the bits needed to be changed.

Finally, there was a wrinkle in the Sendgrid deployment.  I needed to accept the terms for the marketplace.  In fact, the error was very specific:

{% highlight text %}
Deployment failed. Correlation ID: 9a65ff5e-90cf-403f-919b-5ba94c3040e1. {
  "error": {
    "code": "ResourcePurchaseValidationFailed",
    "message": "User failed validation to purchase resources. Error message: 'Legal terms have not been accepted for this item on this subscription: '76b3a38a-6e13-467e-89f5-14e427f2fda8'. To accept legal terms using PowerShell, please use Get-AzureRmMarketplaceTerms and Set-AzureRmMarketplaceTerms API(https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=862451) or deploy via the Azure portal to accept the terms'"
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

First, connect your account using `Connect-AzureRmAccount`.  This is the equivalent of `az login` on the Azure CLI side.  Then accept the terms with the following:

{% highlight powershell %}
Get-AzureRmMarketplaceTerms -Publisher "sendgrid" -Product "sendgrid_azure" -Name "free" | Set-AzureRmMarketplaceTerms -Accept
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, I was able to get a good deployment!  Make sure you also check out the outputs.  This is available in the deployment screen or from the output of the `az group deployment` command.

However, this deployment has just deployed the resources.  I have not configured the database, nor have I deployed any code. That's for next time!  Also, I've not given you the parameters file :-)  I specify the prefix and password for production in an `azure-parameters.json` file.  This looks something like the following:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentParameters.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
    "prefix": { 
      "value": "twprod"
    },
    "sendgridPassword": {
      "value": "GEN-UNIQUE"
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is not checked into the repository since it stores my secrets.  However, I can deploy easily enough with the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
az group deployment create \
  --name prod \
  --resource-group twprod \
  --template-file azuredeploy.json \
