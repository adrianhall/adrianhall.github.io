Confession time.  I hated iOS development.  First, there was Objective-C (which was a nightmare of epic proportions for cryptic syntax), then there was the Storyboards.  Both of them forced you into using what is quite possibly the worst IDE on the market today (XCode), all so you could fit into the Apple ecosystem walled garden, where everything is controlled.  Then Swift came along, so I took another look.  I loved the direction that Swift was going, but Storyboards and the unintuitive IDE still killed in.

SwiftUI might have changed all that for me.

I've spent the last two days pretty much learning SwiftUI, and I've been enjoying it.  That's something I couldn't say about the older efforts to learn iOS programming.  First, I looked at the [Apple tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui), then went onto [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) - one of my favorite sites right now.  Finally, I got down to challenge myself.  I have always admired the artists who post their work on sites like [UpLabs](https://uplabs.com) and [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com), so I decided to take a look and see if I could replicate one of their UIs within SwiftUI.

I could, and it only took my about half an hour.

## The project

The project I chose was a [Weather app](https://dribbble.com/shots/7106462-Weather-App?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=Chrisiwan&utm_content=Weather%20App&utm_medium=Social_Share) by Chris Iwan, who provided the screen shots and colors. Here is the screen shot:

He also provided five colors for a palette, which we will get onto within the code.
